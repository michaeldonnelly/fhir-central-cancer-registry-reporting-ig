This section defines the specific requirements for systems wishing to conform to actors specified in this MedMorph Central Cancer Registry Reporting Content IG.  The specification focuses on using the Health Data Exchange App (HDEA), MedMorph's backend services app, to report cancer data to central cancer registries.

### Context

#### Pre-reading
Before reading this formal specification, implementers should first be familiar with these sections of the specification:

* The [Use Cases](usecases.html) page provides the business context and general process flow enabled by the formal specification.


#### Conventions
This implementation guide uses specific terminology to flag statements that have relevance for the evaluation of conformance with the guide:

* **SHALL** indicates requirements that must be met to be conformant with the specification.

* **SHOULD** indicates behaviors that are strongly recommended (and which may result in interoperability issues or sub-optimal behavior if not adhered to), but which do not, for this version of the specification, affect the determination of specification conformance.

* **MAY** describes optional behaviors that are free to consider but where there is no recommendation for or against adoption.


#### Claiming Conformance 

Actors and Systems asserting conformance to this implementation guide have to implement the requirements outlined in the corresponding capability statements. The following definition of MUST SUPPORT is to be used in the implementation of the requirements.

##### MUST SUPPORT Definition

* Systems **SHALL** be capable of populating data elements as specified by the profiles and data elements are returned using the specified APIs in the capability statement.
* Systems **SHALL** be capable of processing resource instances containing the MUST SUPPORT data elements without generating an error or causing the application to fail. In other words, Systems SHOULD be capable of displaying the data elements for human use or storing it for other purposes.
* In situations where information on a particular data element is not present and the reason for absence is unknown, Systems **SHALL NOT** include the data elements in the resource instance returned from executing the API requests.
* When accessing Central Cancer Registry Reporting data, Systems **SHALL** interpret missing data elements within resource instances returned from API requests as data not present.
* When data is not available for any of the mandatory elements specified in the IG, a data absent reason extension should be added to satisfy the requirement along with an appropriate value from the [data-absent-reason value set](http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/data-absent-reason).


#### Profiles and Other IGs Usage
This specification makes significant use of [FHIR profiles]({{site.data.fhir.path}}profiling.html), search parameter definitions, and terminology artifacts to describe the content to be shared as part of MedMorph Central Cancer Registry Reporting Content IG workflows. The implementation guide is based on [FHIR R4]({{site.data.fhir.path}}) and profiles are listed for each interaction.

The full set of profiles defined in this implementation guide can be found by following the links on the [FHIR Artifacts](artifacts.html) page.


##### MedMorph Reference Architecture (RA) IG Usage

This IG leverages the [MedMorph RA IG]({{site.data.fhir.ver.medmorphIg}}/index.html) defined by HL7 Public Health WG as the reference architecture for automating and implementing the central cancer registry reporting use case.

##### US Core Usage

This IG leverages the [US Core]({{site.data.fhir.ver.uscoreR4}}) set of profiles defined by HL7 for sharing non-veterinary EMR individual health data in the U.S.  Where US Core profiles exist, this IG either leverages them directly or uses them as a base for any additional constraints needed to support the research use cases.  If no constraints are needed, this IG does not define any profiles.


##### US Public Health (PH) library profiles Usage

This IG leverages the [US PH Library Profiles](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-us-ph-common-library-ig/index.html) as a reference to define the following profile(s) in this IG:

	* USPublicHealthEncounter
	* USPublicHealthPatient


##### mCode FHIR IG Usage

This IG leverages the [mCode FHIR IG]({{site.data.fhir.ver.mcodeIg}}/index.html) for exchanging cancer specific information which includes the following profiles:

	* Primary Cancer Condition
	* Secondary Cancer Condition
	* Cancer Stage Group Information 
	* Cancer Related MedicationRequests 
	* Cancer Related MedicationAdministration
	* TNM Observations 
	* RadiotherapyCourseSummary
	
Implementers **SHOULD** use the [mCode Disease characterization]({{site.data.fhir.ver.mcodeIg}}/group-disease.html) and [mCode Treatment guidance]({{site.data.fhir.ver.mcodeIg}}/group-treatment.html) when using the above profiles.


##### Occupational Data for Health (ODH) IG Usage

This IG leverages the ODH FHIR IG for exchanging occupational data for health which includes the following profile:

	* Usual Work

##### Subscriptions Backport IG Usage

This IG leverages the [Subscriptions Backport IG]({{site.data.fhir.ver.subscriptionsIg}}/index.html) defined by HL7 Infrastructure WG for automating reporting workflows using subscriptions.

##### Bulk Data Access IG Usage

This IG leverages the [FHIR Bulk Data Access IG v1.0.1](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/STU1.0.1/index.html) defined by HL7 Infrastructure WG for enabling authentication and authorization between various actors involved in the workflows. The Bulk Data Access IG is being referenced to use the SMART on FHIR Backend Services Authorization requirements only. The Bulk Data operations related to exporting data for a cohort (Group) or a patient or system level export is not used for this IG.
